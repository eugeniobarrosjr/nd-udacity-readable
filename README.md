This project is my implementation of Readable app which is the final assessment project for the
Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the [React Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/nd019).

Readable is a simple content sharing plateform. Users are able to share articles, as well as reading other shared articles. Users are also able to leave comments on articles.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
